## **There’s a problem**
with how I decide on stuff to do. There’s a lack of objectivity in my brain, leading to decisions based on pure, dopamine induced, animal urge to consume, consume, consume. So this page is hopefully going to shed some light and possibly some solutions on my problem.

_I just like procrastinating._ That’s true. But why though? Yesterday, I’ve heard a [statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha1ZbJIW1f8) by Andrew Huberman, of the [HubermanLab](http://hubermanlab.com), saying:

> “A good life is an expansion of the things that bring you pleasure. \[As opposed to constriction like with addiction for example].”

This makes sense, and I’ve previously wrote that one must expand the environments they experience daily to lead a more enriching and fulfilling life.

This goes in concert with what dr. Huberman was talking about in his podcast regarding addictions. Addictive behaviours lead to diminishing returns on the _“positive”_ effects of a drug. Taking coke will be the *best_thing_ever* for the first X times, but ***only*** for those X times. If one lets their addictions run rampant in their lives, not only will those first X times be the best coke this person ***ever*** had, but they will also progressively feel worse if they don’t get their fix <sup>(assuming consistent quality of the drug)</sup>. Luckily, some things in life are less dangerous (such as porn or video games, etc.), but the principle stays the same. There’s a reason for the idiom “too much of a good thing”.

Dopamine, according to dr. Huberman, should be treated as a motivational mechanism, not the reward itself. Things that give us pleasure when done in moderation, give progressively diminishing returns the longer one receives them with no effort. According to dr. Huberman, we should strive to balance pain to pleasure, so the dopamine inducing activities continue to give us pleasure at their highest capacity. But let’s go a step further. **How much** pain is needed for an activity to be the most pleasurable over time? What are the effects of too much or too little pain? And what if we alternate the amount of pain needed?

## Lets analyse the “facts”
<sub>quotes because I don't have any proof of these concepts</sub>

I can only attest to my own feelings and experiences, so for the sake of the argument, lets imagine I’m hungry (I actually am right now heh). How much pain should I want to go through to get a meal? Well, let’s first say that pain is anything I wouldn’t do unless I needed to for something like a meal. Then let’s explore the options.

-   Cook my own food
    -   Read through a bunch of recipes
    -   Decide on 7
    -   Check pantry
    -   Write down the needed ingredients
    -   Get the ingredients
    -   Cook them
    -   Store for meal prep
    -   Eat (yay fun!)
    -   Clean
-   Order delivery
    -   Open the app
    -   Find a restaurant
    -   Pick the food & order
    -   Receive the food
    -   Eat (yay fun!)
    -   Throw out the trash
-   Go to a restaurant
    -   Find a restaurant (harder than for delivery)
    -   (Optional) Make a reservation
    -   Dress nicely
    -   Drive there
    -   Talk to staff
    -   Decide on the menu item
    -   Eat (yay fun!)
    -   Pay
    -   Drive back
-   Hire a personal chef (I can’t, but just for the sake of the argument)
    -   Find one
    -   Go through the hiring process
    -   Provide them with a kitchen
    -   Tell them what you want to eat
    -   Eat (yay fun!)
    -   Occasionally deal with the chef being unavailable

It’s hard to objectively decide on what to do since there aren’t any real clear-cut winners. Our brain intuitively knows these steps and mushes them together into some sort of value that we then use to decide what to do. But we can _analyse_ _the actual facts_. Each task has some properties that determine our interest in it. **Novelty**, **complexity** and **risk** are some that I can name off of the top of my head.

### **Novelty**
When encountering new tasks there’s some negative anxiety present (for a subpar reward for the given risk, potential injuries or something else) as well as positive (for potential enjoyment). The newer a task is, the more exciting it is to do, positively and negatively. We could say novelty is a time-dependent multiplier for the emotional impact of an outcome of a task on someone. It’s why we have the saying ‘beginner’s luck”. If you’re a seasoned golf player that knows all the ins and outs of golf and are still bested by a beginner, it’s logical to assume they’re lucky, since you’ve worked hard at golf for all that time, and they just happened to be good at it.

### **Complexity**
Each task could be further divided into smaller tasks, depending on a person’s preference. To eat an apple, you take an apple, wash it (turn or the faucet, wash the apple, turn off the faucet, dry the apple and your hands), take a peeler, peel it, put it on a plate, cut it, take the seeds out, throw them and the peels in the trash, clean the counter, eat (yay fun!), clean the table, wash the plate, dry your hands. The more complex a task is, the less likely we are to do it because well, it takes more effort! (Also it might increase the risk)

### **Risk**
Each task presumes some risk with it. Let’s define risk as a set of probabilities for negative outcomes of different magnitudes. We collect this information by either checking publicly available data or recording our own experiences. Risk is exacerbated by novelty. The newer some thing or an activity is to a person, the higher is the risk of something bad happening, because the less skilful they are, the likelier it is for them to make a mistake leading to a negative outcome.

## Why do we do stuff
Our whole lives are based on risk / reward ratios sitting in our heads. We’re always evaluating whether to do something or not based on the potential reward and the risk that goes with it. We have certain values for risk in our heads that often don’t make sense (phobias when high or recklessness when low for example) as they were put there by outside factors or some past experiences transformed them into something completely different. But it is illogical to capitulate to extreme risk values for anything less than empirical evidence supporting said values. Better yet, any risk value needs to be proven, if possible.

> We need to discover the true values of those risks, even if that means tracking the occurrence of negative outcomes in Excel 📊

So if we do stuff based on RR ratio, then why ***don't*** we 

When I’m hungry, I’m subconsciously thinking - am I hungry enough to warrant me standing up and doing all those tasks just to eat an apple? Most of the times I'll just allow the discomfort until I succumb to the pressure of my hormones or forget that I was hungry. I do this often, because it allows me to finish whatever I was doing, but often my hunger distracts me while I think I'm working. I have a “stomach” thought every so often and it will persist until I fall deeper into my work and it goes away. Each moment thinking about something like my hunger is a wasted moment, because I could literally stand up and go eat something.

And each of these moments can be pinpointed to when it occurs. You could trace your thoughts and catch the “I’m hungry, but I don’t want to stand up from the chair just yet.” one. At that exact moment, you know the argument taking place in your head. And then you notice the argument

>😖  I'm hungry < I wanna stay in the chair 😴  

And in that split-second, when you understand what you’re actually allowing to perspire in your mind, it doesn't make sense to stay in the chair and you go and get food. Sometimes it's harder, because you're concentrated on something else, but oftentimes you see that you neglect things that are important to you for the ones that aren't, like eating vs staying in the chair.

Of course, this is a simplified example - there are several factors as to why you don't do things, as I've already stated above. But with the understanding of how this works day-to-day is crucial. I bet you could think right now, of at least 3 different things that you're not doing but have no clear reason why not and instead just shrug them off with *eh.. I guess I just don't feel like it.*

## Let's return to the question
***How much** pain is needed for an activity to be the most pleasurable over time? What are the effects of too much or too little pain? And what if we alternate the amount of pain needed?*

How much pain does breathing cause you? In most cases - none, because we’ve evolved to do it subconsciously and it’s a requirement for existence, let alone doing anything. While it doesn't cause any pain, it doesn't necessarily cause pleasure, because we're so used to it. <sup><i>that's novelty in action</i></sup> Now, how much pain does solving integral equations cause you? Probably a lot, since most of us don’t do it on a daily basis. So if you want to enjoy doing integral equations you need to be doing more of them. I think you know where I’m going with this.

> “The pain associated with a task is inversely proportionate to the skill of the person doing that task. People who are better at something have more fun doing it. People who have fun doing things are likely to continue doing these same things.
 
In order to change your life you need to get better at the tasks necessary to do to get the things and do the activities you want to make a part of your lifestyle.

So let’s say that I’m not really interested in cooking other than not to starve. There’s an insight in that sentence alone, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Therefore cooking is a pain for me. Also, I don’t want to live in a dumpster, which is why I need to take care of my apartment. I have no other sympathies towards cleaning except because it’s a means to an end. These are chores necessary to achieve a certain standard of living. Some people can pay others to do these chores for them, while some need to do them themselves.

If I want to know how to achieve a certain lifestyle, I need to distill the noise to the possessions and activities only at the core of that lifestyle. With that information, I’ll be able to plan the tasks I need to do to achieve it. Once I have the tasks, I can establish whether they are something I’d be doing if I didn’t need to to have that particular lifestyle.
