### Potential opportunities
This is the stuff I'm also interested in

* Making Notion templates
* Web development with React + Tailwind + NextJS
* Wolt delivery
* Digital Marketing
* Mojster.app and other own apps

# What's the plan?

* Programming
	* Get the Mojster app off the ground
	* Make a production ready React app
* Photography
	* Go to one event per week to take some photos and meet some people
	* Setup a print shop for street photography

Since I've decided on 2-4 hours of personal work a day (2 at minimum and 4 if I can squeeze 2 hours in before lunch), I'll be doing Mojster coding as a priority - if possible in the morning and until I've got something to show, I'm not doing anything else, unless Aljaz comes through with the DataBox job. Then I'll put Mojster on pause to do some React stuff to show them, which will be at most 40 hours worth of work.

Since I'm going to code for 4 hours a day on Mojster, there'll be no need to do it on weekends. That's when I'll do photography related stuff like event or street photography and handling prints. Creative photography is still out of scope for the lack of time. Also, gotta remember Zan's wish to get the first print on my website :D

Since I've emailed Wolt about the delivery gig, in case they give me a second chance I'll have to do some work for them. I'm not sure what hours will be required, but I could make some extra money to invest into photography and Mojster.

All-in-all, I've then got 2 major projects - coding and photography (*duh*), with photography divided into street and event photography. Since event photography is my main source of photographic income, I need to use it to get more, better paid gigs.  I will find events to attend during the weekends. Street photography is gonna be meant for prints aka passive income. Perhaps the best way would be to do monthly drops where I collect street photos for a month and then release them in limited amounts depending on the demand.

As for coding, I need to get Mojster off the ground as a proof of concept. If we manage to make a good app that users and vendors will like, we stand a chance of receiving investments to fuel the growth of the business. If that happens, I will still work 10 hours a day, but then only for Mojster, which will be a good increase from 4 hours a day. This way I'll still be able to do my personal hobbies such as photography.

What's the timeline for Mojster? It needs to go into testing in a month. 15th of July 2022. If I take into account only the work week hours, that means I've got 80 hours of work to build a prototype for vendors and customers alike. When me and Aleks decide on the design and give it to Zan and his barbers to click through we'll have the initial prototype ready, which is when
