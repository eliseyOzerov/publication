Sooo, I've already gone for a run (albeit a short one, since I'm a fat fuck) and got absolutely wrecked by it, I've also got a Notion template making course in the mail, which is somewhat intriguing, since I've seen people sell these templates on Gumroad and such, and if I manage to make my own templates, I might stand a chance of making a couple bucks here and there.

Also I've been thinking of doing street photography fot some time, but with a twist. The usual street photography focuses on catching interesting images, then selling them as prints. Since public photography isn't really a thing in Slovenia, I'd like to take photos and draw scribbly faces over actual peoples' faces to anonymize them and sell those as prints under it's own brand like face.si or something similar.

Let me do my morning duties such as toilet and breakfast and I'll be right back.
