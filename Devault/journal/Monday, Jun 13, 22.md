# AAAAAA (excited)
**09:24**
Ok whats gooood my man? Sorry for not talking for the past couple days, they've just been a bit too hectic for me to open the laptop and write some thougths down.

So, what happened in the last couple days you may ask? Well, I've gone to see Jordan Peterson in Ljubjana with Aleks and Erik (Aleks' coworker from DataBox), I've started to actually enjoy going for walks and basking in the sun, I've been to the party I was talking about earlier and now got 2.5k images to cull and edit ðŸ’€, I've went for a trip with a girl I met on IG and now I'm sitting here writing today's entry. I'm still on vacation, so life is good!
