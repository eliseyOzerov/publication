Oh man, I've just had such a nice breakfast! 

**12:50**
And now I've finally rehabilitated myself of said breakfast. Holy shit, is my body actually changing or is McDonalds designed for people to not be able to get enough of it? I guess it's both? I was barely able to eat TWO sandwiches!

1 sandwich:
* 2 slices Olz wholewheat bread (135kcal)
* 3 slices smoked chicken breast (~35 kcal)
* 1 slice gauda cheese (~70kcal)
* some lettuce
* small tomato

So, in total that's like ~500kcal + two glasses of milk which is ~300kcal. I was so full I needed to sleep it off, and it was only ~800kcal. Big Tasty Bacon sandwich in McDonalds is [925kcal](https://mcdonalds.si/ponudba/glavne-jedi/big-tasty-bacon), which they even say is 46% of your suggested daily caloric intake ðŸ˜±  from ONE sandwich. You then pair it with a ~200kcal [coke](https://mcdonalds.si/ponudba/pijace/coca-cola), ~450kcal [fries](https://mcdonalds.si/ponudba/priloge/pommes-frites-veliki), ~350kcal [nuggets](https://mcdonalds.si/ponudba/glavne-jedi/chicken-mcnuggets-9-kos) and 2x ~50kcal [sauces](https://mcdonalds.si/ponudba/dodatki/curry-omaka) and you've eaten ~2000kcal in one sitting, but are gonna be hungry again in a couple hours because the actual food is trash.

And right now, I'm still not even remotely hungry. So what's better - spend **15-17â‚¬** ![[wolt_typical_mcd_order.png|400]]
for a meal that won't even fill you for enough time AND has THE WHOLE DAILY caloric intake in it or eat a home made sandwich for next to nothing, be full for 4-5 hours and still have space for dinner? I think the answer is clear.

Ok, I'm procrastinating writing the code for Mojster.app, so I'll go do that now. Cya later.

**14:37**
Now is the first time since I've eaten that I feel hunger in my stomach. I'm not gonna eat yet, maybe only some raspberries. As I've said, 4-5 hours.

**21:31**
Yeah, so I've eaten much later than I've thought originally lol ðŸ¤£  Not now, but at about 6pm or something like that. I've been quite hungry at that point and having leftovers from yesterday was a life saver.

I still don't know how to handle anxiety properly it seems. I didn't eat at the right time because I was anxious about Mojster and was panicking about what exactly I needed to do etc, but then my human brain prevailed an I went to eat.

Right now I'm sitting here writing some code for Mojster, and it's kind of surreal that I'm developing the app before I even have a design ready. As if the functionalities I've written down and went through with Aleks as well as Å½an don't provide enough information. Since there's no real deadline (I should probably set it up), I feel the mental pressure, but there's no "real" pressure. Or, should I say, my own enterprise gives less pressure than my job, for example, because I don't *need* to do it, per se. I'm not gonna die if I don't do it (or have to move in with my parents, which is a close second), but I am going to lose my reputation with Å½an, in a business sense at least.

As per my reflection today, I'm not sure I'm the business type of guy. I like to create stuff, but the idea of being responsible for a business that employs multiple people and gives a platform to multiple businesses is scary as fuck. I mean, for example, who cares if I mess up a photoshoot, right? Like it's not the end of the world. But what if I make a software design mistake? It could lead to loss of so much money! What am I gonna do then? I'm scared to make mistakes, but as I write this, I acknowledge that mistakes are inevitable. I can't do everything perfectly, no matter how much my childhood trauma wants me to.

So if I can accept that I'm gonna make mistakes, can I devote my whole energy into this? A month (I think) went by since my pitch to Å½an and I still don't have any working code to show for that.

I also just saw some photos of Prva Najvecja that had this glitch edit which looked awesome and started to feel inadequate about my style of event photography ðŸ˜¬  I could obviously incorporate such edits into my photos, but the thought of someone in Maribor being better than me is also scary (because I'll lose the only paid gig I have rn if there's someone better).

And it's not like I want to do everything as well. I only do coding + photography. But I'm so scared man, I can't even explain properly. Maybe it's just in this particular moment, but this is the result of a scarcity mindset. I don't have any assets, nothing to fall back onto, I don't have a portfolio of working apps I can show to potential companies, I only have my photography portfolio on a website that glitches on mobile (thanks Pixpa). On paper I'm (almost) nothing. I'm a jack of some (not all) trades but a master of none.

What's the worst case scenario? I could potentially lose my job, albeit that's unlikely. I could also stagnate at my job while watching my friends get better jobs and better lives by extension. In case I did lose my job though, what are my next steps? Will I be able to quickly find a new one? Well I did do well in the interview with Kamino, but totally bombed the assignment for Infinum, which I actually thought I did great at. Maybe my lack of a degree is haunting me, but there are guys with degrees that know less than me. Should I be studying CS concepts more in depth? There's a whole university course on that, so unless I'm willing to put in every day for the next several years to learn it, I'm not gonna go far.

I'm a Flutter lead at Tovarna, but do I really know anything? Do I know how to create working, good apps? How could I if I have no published, working apps? Ok, maybe SWY, but that app is shit and I didn't even write most of it. Maybe I just need to stay consistent and put in the work and the rest will come. But will it? Well, Aleks had been working for 8 years before moving on to greener pastures. We're the same age, but he's ahead of me because of his experience.

Ok, that's enough of lamenting I suppose. What about the things I think I've got going for me? I don't really believe I've got anything infallible to be fair. Maybe I should just accept that life is an uncertainty and at any given moment shit could hit the fan. But I'm lazy and I don't like that. I want some sense of security to know that no matter what I do and how I fail, I'll have money in my bank account. Hopefully cutting weed and other shit will help with that. I'm not driving to work 2/5 times a week, so I'm saving on gas and food, I'm not ordering from Wolt restaurants anymore, which means more food savings, I barely buy clothes, and I need to stop making impulse purchases. I'm making â‚¬1,7k per month, which is like 50% more than an average Slovene. I need to put that money in savings, the more the better.

My expenses are, again:

| Type               | Amount |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| Rent               | 270    |
| Utilities          | 130    |
| Gas                | 80     |
| Leasing            | 105    |
| Car insurance      | 65     |
| Personal insurance | 35     |
| Phone              | 15     |
| Groceries          | 250    |
| Other              | 50    | 
Which comes to â‚¬1k of expenses. That is insane, I don't even buy stuff to enjoy myself. If I stop buying crap and ordering food, start investing money I make off of photography back into the business (buying a [DJI Mini 2](https://store.dji.com/si/product/mini-2?vid=99471), for example, going to events and advertising my website), and actually saving the rest into an emergency account and eventually some assets, I might actually start feeling safer in life.

I'm super sleepy right now, so I'll be quick. I've made countless goals for myself that I've failed to accomplish. Now, I've got some semblance of self control (thanks, Andrew Huberman) and I can actually be serious about what I do with my life. Given that, here's a goal: Have 1000â‚¬ saved in emergency fund by 18th of September. I'm getting my paycheck in 4 days, I'm paying off any debts (Aleks and overdraft) and that leaves me with â‚¬1,2k. Assuming I don't fall into further debt, I'll also have 2x â‚¬1,7k, which leaves me with about â‚¬1.5k extra funds assuming â‚¬1k monthly expenses, so saving â‚¬1k shouldn't be a problem. And If I make some more money with photography and such, I can also buy myself a drone and leverage that into more event photography business.

If I take this shit seriously, I might stand a chance at not blowing my brains out. Gonna take a shit and go to sleep now. Good to have me back lol.
