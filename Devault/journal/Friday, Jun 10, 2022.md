# Weird morning

**08:19**
What's up brother? I've just eaten my breakfast, which was kinda meh. Tried out Boom Box cereal and was disappointed after a couple bites. It's interesting to observe myself in defining feelings that I have throughout the day. So why weird morning, you ask?

Well, I couldn't fall asleep yesterday over my somewhat unexplained excitement over self-hosting a backend on [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com) (no seriously, this is why I hadn't been able to sleep, wtf is wrong with me). This 'weird' morning is one of those when I know I'm doing the right things but still don't really feel great. But I understand that I won't feel great every day, my body is still gonna mess with me from time to time, I might get sick, have a chemical imbalance, food poisoning, you name it. But at least I won't be the one sabotaging by own health.

I actually didn't smoke weed today yet. That might change, but I've run out.

I think I'll need to do like two journaling sessions a day, maaaybe three.

For almost an hour I'm mucking about changing my Terminal, Obsidian and VSCode themes. Kinda frustrating the [zsh docs](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/index.html#Top) don't have some how-to guides. There needs to be info readily available for that type of stuff. I gotta start collecting information whenever I come around something useful. In the today's age of tech and data, one could say it's imperative to save and compound your informational investments.

I can't find the setting for cursor weight in this [Minimal theme](https://minimal.guide/Home) for Obsidian, but we'll get there. Took a nice poop, procrastinating a bit right now. I notice I procrastinate most when I don't have a clear cut set of tasks I want to accomplish. I probably need to utilize the todo page more. To write a set of tasks I need to do in the day, and really boil them down do each subtask so that I don't need to think what needs to be done. At the end of the day, I'll just save the todo in the daily note to have it at ready to compile a task report on the weekend.

I really like the way Obsidian looks with this theme. I've used the **Gruvbox** theme, with some basic customizations to text. All in all, the plugins for Obsidian are really cool and plentiful, so I'll most likely keep using this app for my organizational needs.

I wanted to write something down both those times but forgot lol ðŸ¤£. Went out for a walk, took some photos, gonna have lunch and edit them after. Also, I've got a party to go to today - to take photos!

This is actually refreshing man. I've gone out for a walk, I'm cooking my own food, I don't have a need to get high (at least right now), I turn off music for the better part of the day, as well as the PC, set the phone on airplane mode and just exist as a person. I imagine we either make up some more tech to help us cope with the current tech we've got, or we go back to tech being a small part of our lives. Like, tech is great. I'm all about it. But I think we're forgetting that we're animals, not so long ago still unconscious and now we're flying in rockets and talk to people via mobile phones, listen to music inside our ears et cetera.

I don't know anything about the statistics right now, but I recognize the sentiment for reducing the exposure to technology in order to improve one's mental health. I truly feel good spending time in nature instead of Slack. Brb, gotta get back to cooking.

Cevapcici are almost done, the rice and the plate are already prepared. EXCITEEEED!!ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³.

It's weird to go back a couple hours and read of my weird morning. I'm feeling pretty good right now, gotta say.

Ok, I'm eating right now, but just so that I won't forget - the onions are quite oniony, they're really strong, but the tomatoes are balancing some of the onions' strength away. I've definitely put too much onion just for myself, and I need to rethink my butter strategy because the cevapcici are kinda sweet and oily. I got overly excited about making food, made too much and now I need to push through. You know the feeling when you think you're gonna gag if you eat one more bite of something. That's how I feel about this last cevapcic.

Ugh, can't upload HEIC's. Converting to jpg... Done! Here's the 'masterpiece' haha ðŸ˜† Also, as you can see I've gotten rid of the horrible drying rack (photo on the right), which was completely useless and a total headache to wash. Having stuff just lie like that makes it much easier to maintain.

Ok, gotta go poop and get ready for the party! See ya tomorrow ðŸ‘‹
