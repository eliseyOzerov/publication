# Weird morning

**08:19**
What's up brother? I've just eaten my breakfast, which was kinda meh. Tried out Boom Box cereal and was disappointed after a couple bites. It's interesting to observe myself in defining feelings that I have throughout the day. So why weird morning, you ask?

Well, I couldn't fall asleep yesterday over my somewhat unexplained excitement over self-hosting a backend on [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com) (no seriously, this is why I hadn't been able to sleep, wtf is wrong with me). This 'weird' morning is one of those when I know I'm doing the right things but still don't really feel great. But I understand that I won't feel great every day, my body is still gonna mess with me from time to time, I might get sick, have a chemical imbalance, food poisoning, you name it. But at least I won't be the one sabotaging by own health.

I actually didn't smoke weed today yet. That might change, but I've run out.

I think I'll need to do like two journaling sessions a day, maaaybe three.

For almost an hour I'm mucking about changing my Terminal, Obsidian and VSCode themes. Kinda frustrating the [zsh docs](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/index.html#Top) are so un-navigatable. There needs to be info readily available for that type of stuff. I gotta start collecting information whenever I come around something useful. In the today's age of tech and data, one could say it's imperative to save and compound your informational investments.

I can't find the setting for cursor weight in this [Minimal theme](https://minimal.guide/Home) for Obsidian, but we'll get there. Took a nice poop, procrastinating a bit right now. I notice I procrastinate most when I don't have a clear cut set of tasks I want to accomplish. I probably need to utilize the todo page more. To write a set of tasks I need to do in the day, and really boil them down do each subtask so that I don't need to think what needs to be done. At the end of the day, I'll just save the todo in the daily note to have it at ready to compile a task report on the weekend.

I really like the way Obsidian looks with this theme. I've used the **Gruvbox** theme, with some basic customizations to text. All in all, the plugins for Obsidian are really cool and plentiful, so I'll most likely keep using this for my organizational needs.

I've just noticed this, but @Obsidian, wtf is with you alignments ðŸ˜¬
