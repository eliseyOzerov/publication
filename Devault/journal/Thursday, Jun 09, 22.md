# Life is good

Yeah so it's been a generally cool day today. I've been smoking since like 6:30 am, which marks an interesting stage in my life, but here we are. 🙂

I've been writing [[activity]] for the better part of the day and actually managed to get together 1800+ words (by now - it's not finished yet). 

Also, I've learned about a bunch of useful SaaS platforms, which will probably cause me to create a page with all those tools :P

**21:09** 
I've come home from hanging out w/ Ivan & Nik. Smoked some pot, drank some beer, ate McDonalds, nothing special. I'd actually like to do something fun instead of just hanging out like wastemen.
