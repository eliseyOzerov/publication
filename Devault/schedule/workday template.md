**work**
1700â‚¬ / month pays for

-   170 hours of availability
-   144 hours of work

fun will henceforth define consuming movies, gaming, youtube or social media content
i can do 2 hours of personal work in the morning as we donâ€™t have any meetings and itâ€™s expected of me to have 6 hours of productive work during the day.

i can eat large, healthy breakfasts to not need to eat during work hours.

originally i planned 3 hours of personal work after usual work, this can be reduced to 2 hours only.

this means then, that I do:

-   **2h** of personal work in the morning
-   **6h** of day job until 4pm
-   **2h** of personal work afterwards

which is a somewhat healthy balance of **6h**/**4h** non-personal / personal work in total of 10 hours of work, which is not THAT much.

then thereâ€™s other lifeâ€™s necessities, such as:

-   **9h** falling asleep + sleep + waking up
-   **2h** food (breakfast + dinner)
-   **1h** personal hygiene

totaling 12 hours

that leaves me with:

-   **30min** journaling + meditation
-   **1.5h** workout / friends / movies / gaming / family

for example (or double journaling and meditation in exchange for **30min** of gaming)

if I work out 4 times a week that gives me 1.5h for fun during the work week.

but this is only the work week, which leaves out the weekends - and I canâ€™t have that, obviously ðŸ˜…

ok, so I worked hard all week and want to relax. maybe stay up a bit late on fridays. I have several options:

1.  at most up to 4am (8 hours of fun on friday but no fun on saturday)
2.  can do up to 12pm (to balance 4h of fun on friday and 4h of fun on saturday)
3.  or go to sleep on time to have time for a sleepover for siblings

I can afford that, because **a)** I worked all week on relevant projects and **b)** even with option 1., Iâ€™ve still got 13pm - 10pm = 9 hours forÂ 

-   **1h** personal hygiene
-   **2h** house cleaning
-   **2h** groceries
-   **2h** meal prep
-   **2h** food (breakfast + dinner)

and thatâ€™s only **saturday**

now on **sunday** Iâ€™ll have 15 hours. I need to take some time to:

-   **30min** review the current weekâ€™s tasks
-   **3h** analyze position within short and long term life strategy

-   if everything checks out quickly, this time can be added to fun

-   **30min** plan the next weekâ€™s tasks
-   **4h** spend with family (home, russia, log)

and then have 7 hours left over for:

-   **2h** outdoor activities (hiking, cycling, street photography, whatever)
-   **1h** journaling + meditation
-   **2h** reading
-   **2h** fun

If i want to maintain this kind of schedule I will probably need to stop smoking weed, as fun as it was. I will also need to track my mood as i notice significant changes.
